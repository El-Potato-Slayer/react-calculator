    <h3>
      Welcome to our page!
    </h3>
    <p>
      We're no strangers to love
       
      <br />
      You know the rules and so do I
       
      <br />
      A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
       
      <br />
      You wouldn't get this from any other guy
       
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
       
      <br />
      Gotta make you understand
       
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Never gonna give you up
       
      <br />
      Never gonna let you down
       
      <br />
      Never gonna run around and desert you
       
      <br />
      Never gonna make you cry
       
      <br />
      Never gonna say goodbye
       
      <br />
      Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
       
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      We've known each other for so long
       
      <br />
      Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
       
      <br />
      Inside we both know what's been going on
       
      <br />
      We know the game and we're gonna play it
       
      <br />
      And if you ask me how I'm feeling
       
      <br />
      Don't tell me you're too blind to see
       
      <br />
      <br />

      Never gonna give you up
       
      <br />
